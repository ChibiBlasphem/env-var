_asStrictBool_ function

## 2.0.0 (27 July 2016)
* Add CI process for node 6, 5, 4, and 0.10
* Add chained functions for variable validations
* Add assertions for _required()_ and various type checks, e.g _asPositiveInt(_)
* Remove node 0.8.x support
* Remove old pattern of returning variables directly
* Continue support for defaults from 1.X

## <2.0.0
* Venture forth at thine risk, for here be dragons
